Mousetweaks 3.3.90
------------------

Description:

    The Mousetweaks package provides mouse accessibility enhancements for
    the GNOME desktop. These enhancements are created by a daemon and they
    consist of:

    1. A way to perform the various clicks without using any hardware
    button. There are two methods to control what click-type should be
    automatically performed:
    - by choosing the next click-type in the click-type window
    - by performing a determined gesture after the dwell timout

    2. A way to perform a right click by doing a click&hold of the left
    mousebutton. (For a left-handed mouse user, the termes left and right
    have to be inverted.)

    Both features can be started in GNOME in the Universal Access panel of
    the System Settings. But there is not a graphical interface for all the
    options of mousetweaks. The graphical interface, apart the click-type
    window, is not part of the mousetweaks package.

    Mousetweaks also offers a command line interface and a dbus interface.
    The latter can be especially interesting for other distributions, that
    want to provide a different graphical interface to control the features
    of the mousetweaks daemon.
