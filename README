Mousetweaks 3.3.90
------------------

Description:

    The Mousetweaks package provides mouse accessibility enhancements for 
    the GNOME desktop. These enhancements are:
    
    1. It offers a way to perform the various clicks without using any 
    hardware button.

    2. It allows users to perform a right click by doing a click&hold 
    of the left mousebutton. (For a left-handed mouse user, the termes 
    left and right have to be inverted.) 

    The options can be accessed through the Accessibility tab of the
    Mouse Preferences of the GNOME Control Center or through the
    the command-line interface.

Distribution Notes:

    Mousetweaks is implemented as a daemon that only runs when one of its
    features has been enabled.

    Apart the click-type window that can be used to control the type of
    the next simulated click, there is no graphical user interface
    shipping with mousetweaks. Distributions can create their own
    graphical user interface matching their desktop and use dbus to
    completely control mousetweaks.
