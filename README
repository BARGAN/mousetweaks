Mousetweaks 0.3.0
-----------------

Description:

	The Mousetweaks package provides mouse accessibility enhancements for 
	the GNOME desktop. These enhancements are:
	
	1. It offers a way to perform the various clicks without using any 
	hardware button.

	2. It allows users to perform a right click by doing a click&hold 
	of the left mousebutton. (For a left-handed mouse user, the termes 
	left and right have to be inverted.) 

	3. It provides an applet that the user can install on a panel. This
	applet creates an area on the panel into which the pointer can 
	be captured until the user releases it with a predefined button
	and modifier combination.
