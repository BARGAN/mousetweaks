    <para>The <application>Mousetweaks</application> application provides
    mouse accessibility enhancements for the GNOME Desktop. Indeed, it offers
    the following new pointer functions to the user:</para>

    <title>How to start the features</title>

    <para>The right click feature and the buttonless click feature of
    <application><application>Mousetweaks</application></application> depend
    on the mousetweaks process; however the pointer capture applet depends on
    the gnome panel. Consequently, they have to be started differently:</para>

        <para>The manual assumes a right-handed user: consequently, left mouse

        indicates the secondary mouse button. Of course, for a left-handed
        user that has enabled the corresponding option in the Mouse control
        panel, the terms left and right have to be exchanged.</para>

    <sect2 id="mt-delay-click">
      <title>Right clicking with the left button</title>

      <para>When the user activates this feature, he will be able to perform
      right clicks by using the <mousebutton>left mouse button</mousebutton>.
      This is especially useful for users that have only one
      <mousebutton>mouse button</mousebutton> at their disposal.</para>

        <para>How long the user has to hold the <mousebutton>left mouse

      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="mt-delay-characteristics">
        <title>Differences to the normal right button click</title>

        <para>As <application>Mousetweaks</application> is not able to discard
        the <mousebutton>left mouse button down</mousebutton> gesture from the
        <mousebutton>left button press</mousebutton> of the user, it issues a
        left click before issuing the right click. In other words, each right
        click performed by this feature of mousetweaks is immediately preceded
        by a left click, and this makes it behave a bit differently to the
        normal right click performed by the <mousebutton>right mouse
        button</mousebutton>. For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is not possible to perform a right click on multiple
            items because the left click issued before the right click
            deselects the items.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When this type of right click is performed on the trash icon
            on the panel, not only does the contextual menu appear, but the
            trash folder does also open. (The former is caused by the right
            click, the latter by the left click preceding the right
            click.)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <note>
          <para>It is not possible to provide a list of all diverging
          behaviours, because it depends on the reaction of the application
          receiving the right click preceded by a left click.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Some users may also be surprised by the behaviour caused by the
        fact, that it is not possible to perform a long motionless left click
        and hold, without also doing a right click. For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When doing a motionless left click and hold on the arrow of
            a scrollbar, the scrollbar jumps to the bottom after some time.
            This is in fact the normal behaviour of a right click on an arrow
            of a scrollbar.</para>

            <tip>
              <para>To work around this behaviour, simply move the pointer
              immediately after pressing the <mousebutton>mouse
              button</mousebutton>. This way
              <application>Mousetweaks</application> does not issue the right
              click.</para>
            </tip>

    <sect2 id="mt-dwell-click">
      <title>Clicking without the use of any hardware button</title>

      <para>By activating this feature, users will be able to perform left
      clicks, double clicks, drag clicks and right clicks without having to
      press any <mousebutton>mouse button</mousebutton>.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When the buttonless click is active, the <mousebutton>mouse

      <sect3 id="mt-dwell-trigger-choice">
        <title>Click trigger and click type choice</title>

        <para>The user can choose between two methods to trigger the clicks:
        by time or by gesture. There are two radio buttons for this purpose in
        the control panel of Mousetweaks.</para>

          <title>Trigger by time</title>

          <para>In the trigger by time method, the Mousetweaks application
          automatically performs the click after the pointer has been
          motionless for a determined time.</para>

          time lapse that the pointer has to be motionless before performing
          the click.</remark>

          <para>The type of click performed depends on the selection in the
          click type window or click type applet. Have a look at the following

          <title>Trigger by gesture</title>

          <para>In the trigger by gesture method, the shape of the pointer
          changes to the gesture shape after being motionless for a determined
          time.</para>

          <remark>See <link linkend="mt-dwell-time-setting">Time settings for
          buttonless clicks</link> for more information about how to set the
          time lapse that the pointer has to be motionless before its shape
          changes to the gesture shape.</remark>

          <para>If the user moves the pointer while it is showing the gesture
          shape, a click is performed. Moreover, the type of click performed
          depends on the direction that the user moved the pointer.</para>

          <para>If the user does not move the pointer while it is showing the
          gesture shape, its shape returns to the normal pointer shape and the
          user can again move the pointer without a click being
          performed.</para>

          <para>There is a section in the control panel of Mousetweaks for the
          user to map click type to movement direction:</para>

          also a <guimenuitem>Disabled</guimenuitem> menu item in each
          <guimenu>popup</guimenu>, so that user can disable the click types
          that he does not want to be performed automatically. This is
          especially interesting for users that have problems only with
          certain click types.</para>

      <title>Locking the pointer</title>

      <para>There are people that have to use their pointing device not only
      for the computer. These people would welcome a way to lock the pointer
      into an area of the screen, so that they can use their pointing device
      for other tasks. The <application>Mousetweaks</application> application
      ships with an applet called Pointer Capture that creates an area on the
      panel into which the user can lock the pointer until he releases it in a
      determined way.</para>

          <para>In the Capture Pointer section, the user can specify under

          capture area. For example: if the control modifier is checked, the
          pointer gets captured when it is over the capture area and the user
          presses the Control modifier key. If no modifier is checked and the
          mouse button is set to 0, the pointer only has to move into the
          capture area to get locked.</para>
