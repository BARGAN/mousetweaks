    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The <application>mousetweaks module</application> provides mouse
    accessibility enhancements for the GNOME Desktop. Indeed, it offers the
    following new functions to the user:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Simulated secondary click: it allows the user to perform a
        secondary click (menu click) by holding down the primary mouse button
        while keeping the pointer motionless.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Dwell click: it allows the user to perform the various clicks
        without pressing any <hardware>hardware button</hardware>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Pointer capture: it allows the user to lock the pointer in a
        determined area of the panel until the user releases it by a
        predefined keystroke or mouse button.</para>

  <sect1 id="mouse-a11y-how-to-start-features">
    <title>How To Start The Functions</title>

    <para>The simulated secondary click and the dwell click depend on the
    mousetweaks process; however the pointer capture applet depends on the
    gnome panel. Consequently, they have to be started differently.</para>

      <sect3 id="mouse-a11y-ssc-pecularities">
        <title>Differences To The Normal Secondary Click</title>

        <para>As the simulated secondary click is not able to discard the
        <mousebutton>mouse button down</mousebutton> gesture from the
        <mousebutton> primary button press</mousebutton> of the user, it
        issues a primary click before issuing the secondary click. In other
        words, each secondary click performed by this function is immediately
        preceded by a primary click, and this makes it behave a bit
        differently to the normal secondary click performed by the
        <mousebutton>secondary mouse button</mousebutton>. For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is not possible to perform a secondary click on multiple
            items because the primary click issued before the secondary click
            deselects the items.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When the simulated secondary click is performed on the trash
            icon on the panel, not only does the contextual menu appear, but
            the trash folder does also open. (The former is caused by the
            secondary click, the latter by the primary click preceding the
            right click.)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <note>
          <para>It is not possible to provide a list of all diverging
          behaviours, because it depends on the reaction of the application
          receiving the secondary click preceded by a primary click.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Some users may also be surprised by the consequences of the
        following: it is not possible to perform a long motionless primary
        button click and hold, without also triggering the secondary click.
        For example:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When doing a motionless primary button click and hold on the
            arrow of a scrollbar, the scrollbar jumps to the bottom after some
            time. This is in fact the normal behaviour of a secondary click on
            an arrow of a scrollbar.</para>

            <tip>
              <para>To work around this behaviour, simply move the pointer
              immediately after pressing the <mousebutton>primary mouse
              button</mousebutton>. This way the simulated secondary click is
              not issued.</para>

        <title>How To Complete Clicks And Specify The Click Type</title>

        <para>Each time she pointer stops moving, a click is initiated. How
        the click is completed and how the click type is chosen depends on
        what dwell mode the user has selected. The two available modes
        are:</para>
